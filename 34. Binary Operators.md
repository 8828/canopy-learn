- **<font size=3>BROADCAST</font>**

**The basic binary mathematical operators, addition(+), subtraction (-), multiplication (), and division (/) support element-by-element operations between two arrays. For operations between an array and a scalar, the scalar is "broadcast" across each value in the array. In the example below where the scalar, 3, is multiplied with an array, a, 3 is multiplied with each value in the array. The remainder operator, %, and the power operator, `*`, also follow these same rules.**

**Note: The "broadcasting" idea actually extends beyond scalar-array operations and will, when certain conditions are met, allow operations between two arrays with different shapes.**

```python
a = array([1,2])
[In]:a * 3
[Out]:array([3, 6])

a = array([1,2])
b = array([3,4])
[In]:a * b
[Out]:array([3, 8])
```

- **<font size=3>USING FUNCTION</font>**

symbol|function
------|--------
a + b|add(a, b)
a - b|subtract(a, b)
a % b|remainder(a, b)
a * b|multiply(a, b)
a / b|divide(a, b)
a ** b|power(a, b)

**There is an identical "functional" form of all of these operators, add, subtract, multiply, divide, remainder, and power. They are rarely used by end users in normal data analysis, but the can come in handy when writing applications that need to evaluate mathematical expressions. These functions, in their basic form, take two inputs, a and b below, and produce a third array which is the result.**

```python
[In]:multiply(a,b)
[Out]:array([3, 8])
```

- **<font>IN-PLACE OPERATIONS</font>**

**The binary operators actually will accept a third argument, an array where the results from the operation are written. The array must of the correct shape for the output array. This can be used to write the results into a pre-allocated array, saving the array creation time for the results and potentially improving performance.**

**In the following case, the output array is also one of the input arrays. This results in an "inplace" operation where the results overwrite the contents of one of the input operators. This has the additional performance benefit of reducing the amount of memory that moves through the cache during the operations (only two arrays instead of three). It is, however, at the expense of readability in anything but the most trivial operation. As a result, it isn't encouraged accept in very particular situations where performance is absolute king. And, even in those situations, it is likely that a tool like cython or numexpr will provide similar or better results without degrading readability as severely.**

```python
[In]: multiply(a,b,a) # a += b
[Out]:array([3, 8])
```

*2D example*

```python
a = array([[1,2,3,4],
           [2,3,4,5]])
b = array([[1,2,5,4],
           [1,3,4,5]])
[In]:a == b
[Out]:array([[ True,  True, False,  True],
             [False,  True,  True,  True]], dtype=bool)
[In]:a > b
[Out]:array([[False, False, False, False],
             [ True, False, False, False]], dtype=bool)
```

**<font color="orange">_Be careful_ with _if_ statements involving NumPy arrays. To test for equality of arrays,</font>**

**don't do :**

``if a == b:``

**rather, do:**

``if all(a == b):``

**For floating point:**

``if allclose(a, b):``

- **<font>LOGICAL OPERATION</font>**

**logical_and, logical_not, logical_or, and logical_xor provide an element-by-element logical comparison between two arrays. While Bitwise operations are more common and accomplish the same thing when operating on boolean arrays, they are particularly useful in comparing values from arrays with different dtypes.**

```python
a = array([0,  1, 2], dtype=float32)
b = array([0, 10, 0], dtype=int32)
[In]: logical_and(a,b)
[Out]:array([False,  True, False], dtype=bool)
```

- **<font>BITWISE OPERATION</font>**

```python
a = array([1,   2,  4,   8], dtype=uint8)
b = array([16, 32, 64, 128], dtype=uint8)

# bitwise or
[In]:a | b
[Out]:array([ 17,  34,  68, 136], dtype=uint8)

a = array((1,2,3,4), uint8)
[In]:~a
[Out]:array([254, 253, 252, 251], dtype=uint8)

a = array([1, 2, 4, 8], dtype=uint8)
[In]:a << 3
[Out]:array([ 8, 16, 32, 64], dtype=uint8)
```

**When combing comparisons with bitwise operations, precedence requires parntheses around the comparisons**

```python
a = array([1, 2, 3, 4])
b = array([16, 32, 64, 128])
[In]: (a>3) & (b<100)
[Out]:array([False, False, False, False], dtype=bool)
```
