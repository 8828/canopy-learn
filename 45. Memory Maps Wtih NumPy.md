+ One of the great features of NumPy is that it works very well with memory maps.

+ Memory maps has many features. The two main ones that you’ll run into are wanting to have a single segment of memory that’s shared between two applications, and so you might have a NumPy array that can look at that memory and manipulate it while the other program is as well.

+ The second thing that you run into quite a bit is having large files on disc that you want to, instead of loading the entire array into memory, you want to have an array that views that file as an array, but only will load the data as it’s needed out of the file.

- Methods for Creating:
    - __`memmap`__: subclass of ndarray that manages the memory mapping details.
    - __`frombuffer`__: Create an array from a memory mapped buffer object.
    - __`ndarray` constructor__: Use the `buffer` keyword to pass in a memory mapped buffer.
- Limitations:
    - Python 2.5 and higher on 64 bit machines is theoretically "limited" to 17.2 billion GB (17 Exabytes).
    - Files must be < 2GB on 32-bit machines.

- **MEMMAP SINGLE ARRAY**

*NumPy natively reads npy files as memory maps*

```python
a = array([[1.0, 2.0],
           [3.0, 4.0]])

# Save to an uncompressed binary file.
fname = 'afile.npy' 
save(fname, a)

# Memory map file into aa as a read-only array.
aa = load(fname, mmap_mode='r')
[In]: aa
[Out]:memmap([[ 1.,  2.],
              [ 3.,  4.]])
```

- **MEMMAP MULTIPLE ARRAY**

*NumPy natively reads npyz files in memory mapped mode*

```python
a = array([[1.0, 2.0],
           [3.0, 4.0]])
b = array([0.5, 1.5])

# Save as uncompressed file.
fname = 'abfile.npz' 
savez(fname, a=a, b=b)
# Memory map file into array aa as a read-only array.
f = load(fname, mmap_mode='r')
[In]:f['a']
[Out]:array([[ 1.,  2.],
             [ 3.,  4.]])
[In]:f['b']
[Out]:array([ 0.5,  1.5])
```

Creating a "memory mapped" array where the array data is stored in a file on disk instead of in main memory

```python
# we have a binary file which has header data to describe the data itself.

image = memmap('some_file.dat', 
               dtype=uint16,
               mode='r+',
               shape=(5, 5),
               offset=header_size)
# convert binary data to needed data type, as dtype=uint16. To read and modify 
# data, using mode='r+'. offset header data to get main data.

# standard array methods work
mean-value = image.mean()

# standard math operations work. The resulting scaled_image is stored in main 
# memory. It is a standard numpy array. 
scaled_image = image * .5
```

**memmap** parameters:
    
**filename** : str, file-like object, or pathlib.Path instance
The file name or file object to be used as the array data buffer.

**dtype** : data-type, optional
The data-type used to interpret the file contents. Default is uint8.

**mode** : {‘r+’, ‘r’, ‘w+’, ‘c’}, optional
The file is opened in this mode:
‘r’     Open existing file for reading only.
‘r+’    Open existing file for reading and writing.
‘w+’    Create or overwrite existing file for reading and writing.
‘c’     Copy-on-write: assignments affect data in memory, but changes are not saved to disk. The file on disk is read-only.
Default is ‘r+’.

**offset** : int, optional
In the file, array data starts at this offset. Since offset is measured in bytes, it should normally be a multiple of the byte-size of dtype. When `mode != 'r'`, even positive offsets beyond end of file are valid; The file will be extended to accommodate the additional data. By default, memmap will start at the beginning of the file, even if filename is a file pointer `fp` and `fp.tell() != 0`.

**shape** : tuple, optional
The desired shape of the array. If `mode == 'r'` and the number of remaining bytes after offset is not a multiple of the byte-size of dtype, you must specify shape. By default, the returned array will be 1-D with the number of elements determined by file size and data-type.

**order** : {‘C’, ‘F’}, optional
Specify the order of the ndarray memory layout: row-major, C-style or column-major, Fortran-style. This only has an effect if the shape is greater than 1-D. The default order is ‘C’

*write mode*

```python
# create a memory mapped "write through" file, overwriting it if it exists.
q = memmap('new_file.dat', mode='w+', shape=(2, 5))
[In]:q
[Out]: memmap([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=uint8)
# print out the contents of the underlying file.
# note: it doesn't print because  isn't a printable ascii character.
! cat new_file.dat

# write the ascii value for 'A'(65) into array
q[:] = ord('A')
q.flush()
# flush()   Write any changes in the array to the file on disk.
!cat new_file.dat
AAAAAAAAAA
```

*copy mode*

```python
# create a copy-on-write memory map where the underlying file is never 
# modified. The file must already exist. This is a memory efficient way of 
# working with data on disk as arrays but ensuring you never modify it
q = memmap('new_file.dat', mode='c', shape=(2, 5))

# set values in array to something now
q[1] = ord('B')
q.flush()
# the underlying file is not updated
!cat new_file.dat
# AAAAAAAAAA
```

*offset*

```python
# create a memory mapped array with 10 elements
q = memmap('new_file.dat', mode='w+', dtype=uint8, shape=(10, ))
q[:] = arange(0, 100, 10)
# memmap([0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90], dtype=uint8)

# create a new memory mapped array(read only) with an offset into the 
# previously created file
q = memmap('new_file.dat', mode='r', dtype=uint8, shape=6, offset=4)
[In]:q
[Out]: memmap([40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90], dtype=uint8)

# note that the sum number of shape and offset is not larger than the total 
# bytes of file data
```
