#11. Slices Are References
---------------------------

**<table><tr><td bgcolor=#00b0ff>ARRAY REFERENCS</td></tr></table>**

***Slices are references to memory in the original array. Changing values in a slice also changes the original array.***

```python
a = array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
# slice
b = a[2:4]
# b = array([2, 3])
[In]: b[0] = 10
# Changing b changed a
[In]: a
[Out]: array([0, 1, 10, 3, 4])
```
***Whenever you take a slice of one array and assign it to another, the second array is a reference to the first. They share the same memory.***

***This is an efficient way to change the original array. By that, you’re not always arbitrarily making copies of arrays when you don’t need to.

**<table><tr><td bgcolor=#00b0ff>COPYING TO BREAK REFERENCE</td></tr></table>**

```python
b = b.copy()
b = a[2:4].copy()
```
